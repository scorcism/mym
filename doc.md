### **Task Outline: Enhancing Chrome Extension to Interact with IndexedDB and an External Database**

Objective:

1. Make a chrome extension on top of google chrome and have it make api calls to an external source and then persist it to a Database of your choosing. Use webhooks to send the data to the database
2. Modify our existing Chrome Extension to fetch data from an external free API, save this data to both IndexedDB (for local caching) and an external Cloud Database (for persistent storage), and display a webpage that retrieves data first from IndexedDB for faster loading and subsequently fetches the remainder of the data from our Cloud Database.

**Task Details:**

External API Integration:

Familiarize yourself with the structure and specifications of the free external API we will be using. Implement functionality in our existing Chrome Extension to fetch data from this API. Test the data retrieval process to ensure that it's working as expected.

IndexedDB Interaction:

a. Implement functionality to persist the data obtained from the external API to IndexedDB for local caching. Ensure to appropriately structure the data for efficient storage and retrieval.

b. Also implement a retrieval function that can fetch data from the IndexedDB. This function should be used later when loading the webpage.

Cloud Database Interaction:

a. Alongside persisting data to IndexedDB, also store this data in our external Cloud Database. Ensure you handle any authentication and security requirements of the database.

b. Create a function to retrieve data from our Cloud Database. This function should be used when data is not available in the IndexedDB or for lazily loading the remainder of the data.

Webpage Display:

Create a webpage that can display the data retrieved from the IndexedDB and Cloud Database. The page should initially try to load data from the IndexedDB for a faster response. If the data is not available or after the initial display, it should then fetch the remainder of the data from the Cloud Database.

Use Case Implementation:

As a specific use case, implement the scenario where we need to show the latest 25 messages of a user. The initial load should come from the IndexedDB for a quicker response, and then the remaining messages should be loaded from our Cloud Database lazily.

**Requirements:**

Pay attention to error handling - ensure the application can handle cases where data fetching, storing, or displaying fails.

Ensure the application is secure and data integrity is maintained.

Test each function and the overall process thoroughly to make sure everything works together as expected.

Document your code and the process flow so other engineers can understand and maintain your work.
